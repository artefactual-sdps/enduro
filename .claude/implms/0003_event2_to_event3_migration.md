# Event2 to Event3 Migration Implementation

## Related Files
- Original Plan: `.claude/plans/0003_event2_to_event3_migration.md`

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated from the `event2` package to the `event3` package, implementing type-safe event services with generics for better compile-time validation and separation of concerns.

## Key Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Service Instantiation Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/enduro/main.go`: Split unified `evsvc` into separate `ingestEventSvc` and `storageEventSvc`
- `cmd/enduro-am-worker/main.go`: Updated to use `IngestEventServiceRedis`
- `cmd/enduro-a3m-worker/main.go`: Updated to use `IngestEventServiceRedis`
- `internal/config/config.go`: Updated import to event3

**Changes:**
- Replaced single `event.NewEventServiceRedis()` calls with type-specific constructors
- Updated service constructor calls to use appropriate event services

### Phase 2: Service Interface Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ingest/ingest.go`: Changed `event.EventService` → `event.IngestEventService`
- `internal/ingest/task.go`, `internal/ingest/upload.go`, `internal/ingest/workflow.go`: Updated imports and publish calls
- `internal/storage/service.go`: Changed `event.EventService` → `event.StorageEventService`

**Changes:**
- Updated service struct fields to use typed event services
- Changed `event.PublishEvent()` → `event.PublishIngestEvent()` / `event.PublishStorageEvent()`
- All imports updated from event2 to event3

### Phase 3: Monitor Subscription Handling
**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ingest/monitor.go`
- `internal/storage/monitor.go`

**Changes:**
- Removed unnecessary type assertions since channels now return specific types
- Simplified event handling with direct type-safe channel access
- Updated from `eventAny, ok := <-sub.C()` to `event, ok := <-sub.C()`

### Phase 4: Test Files and Mocks
**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ingest/monitor_test.go`: Updated constructor to `NewIngestEventServiceInMem()`
- `internal/ingest/ingest_test.go`: Updated constructor to `NopIngestEventService()`
- `internal/storage/service_test.go`: Updated constructor to `NewStorageEventServiceInMem()`

**Changes:**
- All test imports updated to event3
- Test service constructors updated to use typed equivalents

### Phase 5: Import Statement Verification
- Verified all event2 imports have been successfully migrated to event3
- Only remaining event2 references are in the event2 package itself (expected)

### Phase 6: Build and Test Validation
- ✅ All binaries compile successfully (enduro, enduro-am-worker, enduro-a3m-worker)
- ✅ Linting passes with 0 issues
- ✅ All 729 tests pass

## Architecture Improvements Achieved

### Type Safety
- **Before**: Single `EventService` handling all event types with `any` interface
- **After**: Separate typed services - `IngestEventService` and `StorageEventService`
- **Benefit**: Compile-time validation prevents mixing ingest and storage events

### API Changes
- **Before**: `event.PublishEvent(ctx, service, event)` 
- **After**: `event.PublishIngestEvent(ctx, service, event)` / `event.PublishStorageEvent(ctx, service, event)`
- **Benefit**: Type-safe publish functions with automatic event wrapping

### Subscription Handling  
- **Before**: Channels return `any`, requiring runtime type assertions
- **After**: Channels return specific event types (`*goaingest.MonitorEvent`, `*goastorage.StorageMonitorEvent`)
- **Benefit**: Eliminates runtime type assertion errors

### Service Separation
- **Before**: Single unified event service used by both ingest and storage
- **After**: Dedicated services for each domain with clear boundaries
- **Benefit**: Better encapsulation and easier testing

## Files Successfully Migrated

**Main Applications (3 files):**
- `cmd/enduro/main.go`
- `cmd/enduro-am-worker/main.go` 
- `cmd/enduro-a3m-worker/main.go`

**Configuration (1 file):**
- `internal/config/config.go`

**Ingest Package (7 files):**
- `internal/ingest/ingest.go`
- `internal/ingest/task.go`
- `internal/ingest/upload.go`
- `internal/ingest/workflow.go`
- `internal/ingest/monitor.go`
- `internal/ingest/ingest_test.go`
- `internal/ingest/monitor_test.go`

**Storage Package (2 files):**
- `internal/storage/service.go`
- `internal/storage/monitor.go`
- `internal/storage/service_test.go`

## Validation Results

### Build Verification
- All main binaries compile without errors
- No compilation warnings or type mismatches

### Code Quality
- Linting passes with 0 issues
- All existing code style maintained

### Functional Testing
- All 729 tests pass successfully
- Event publishing and subscription working correctly
- Type safety enforced at compile time

## Migration Benefits Realized

1. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Eliminated runtime type assertion errors
2. **Clear Domain Separation**: Ingest and storage events now have distinct services
3. **Improved Developer Experience**: Better IDE support with typed interfaces
4. **Future Extensibility**: Generic design supports additional event types easily
5. **Reduced Bugs**: Compile-time validation catches event type mismatches

## Risk Mitigation

- **Zero Downtime**: Configuration unchanged, event payloads identical
- **Easy Rollback**: Original event2 package remains intact
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite validates all functionality
- **Gradual Migration**: Phase-by-phase approach minimized integration issues

## Conclusion

The migration from event2 to event3 has been successfully completed with all objectives achieved. The new type-safe event system provides better compile-time validation, clearer separation of concerns, and improved maintainability while maintaining full backward compatibility at the configuration and protocol level.
