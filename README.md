# Enduro

Enduro is a new application under development by Artefactual Systems. Originally
created as a more stable replacement for Archivematicaâ€™s automation tools
library of scripts, it has since evolved into a flexible tool to be paired with
preservation applications to provide initial ingest activities such as content
and structure validation, packaging, and more.

Enduro aims to cover our client's needs while exploring new and innovative ways
to build durable and fault-tolerant workflows suited for preservation.
