# Enduro

Enduro is a tool designed to automate the processing of transfers in multiple
Archivematica pipelines. It's part of a preservation solution that is being
used by the [National Health Archive (NHA)] and the [National Center for Truth
and Reconciliation (NCTR)].

It's a **proof of concept** at its very early stages. It aims to cover our
client's needs while exploring new and innovative ways to build durable and
fault-tolerant workflows suited for preservation.

## Local environment

Enduro uses Tilt to set up a local environment building the Docker images in a
Kubernetes cluster. It has been tested with k3d, Minikube and Kind.

### Requirements

- [Docker] (v18.09+)
- [kubectl]
- [Tilt] (v0.22.2+)

A local Kubernetes cluster:

- [k3d] _(recomended, used in CI)_
- [Minikube] _(tested)_
- [Kind] _(tested)_

It can run with other solutions like Microk8s or Docker for Desktop/Mac and
even against remote clusters, check Tilt's [Choosing a Local Dev Cluster] and
[Install] documentation for more information to install these requirements.

Additionally, follow the [Manage Docker as a non-root user] post-install guide
so that you donâ€™t have to run Tilt with `sudo`.

### Set up

Start a local Kubernetes cluster with a local registry. For example, with k3d:

```
k3d cluster create sdps-local --registry-create sdps-registry
```

Make sure kubectl is available and configured to use that cluster:

```
kubectl config view
```

Clone this repository and move into its folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/artefactual-sdps/enduro.git
cd enduro
```

Bring up the environment:

```
tilt up
```

While the Docker images are built/downloaded and the Kubernetes resources are
created, hit `space` to open the Tilt UI in your browser. Check the [Tilt UI]
documentation to know more about it.

### Access

There are four services available from the host:

- Enduro dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Minio console: http://localhost:7460 (username: minio, password: minio123)
- Temporal UI: http://localhost:7440
- Opensearch dashboards: http://localhost:7500

### Live updates

Tilt will watch for file changes in the project folder and it will sync those
changes, rebuild the Docker images and recreate the resources when necessary.
The `enduro-dashboard` uses Vite to serve the application in development with
hot reload. The `enduro` and `enduro-a3m-worker` services require rebuilding
the entire images - these will take longer to update.

Additionally, there are refresh buttons on each resource in the Tilt UI that
allow triggering manual updates and re-executing jobs and local resources.

### Stop/start the environment

Run `ctrl-c` on the terminal where `tilt up` is running and stop the cluster
with:

```
k3d cluster stop sdps-local
```

To start the environment again:

```
k3d cluster start sdps-local
tilt up
```

### Clear the cluster

To remove the resources created by Tilt in the cluster, execute:

```
tilt down
```

However, that won't remove all the persistent volumes at the moment, to do so
run:

```
kubectl delete pvc,pv --all
```

### Delete the cluster

Deleting the cluster will remove all the resources from above, but it will also
remove the container registry with the Docker images and the cluster container
from the host. With k3d, run:

```
k3d cluster delete sdps-local
```

### Tilt UI helpers

#### Upload to Minio

In the Tilt UI header there is a cloud icon/button that allows you to configure
and trigger an upload to the `sips` bucket in Minio. Click the caret to set the
path to a file/directory in the host and a Minio object name, then click the
cloud icon to trigger the upload.

For example, to upload an existing sample ZIP from the project folder (make
sure you update `/path/to/enduro` to the proper project folder in the host):

- Host path: `/path/to/enduro/hack/sampledata/StructB-AM.zip`
- Object name: `StructB-AM.zip`

### [Linkerd] Service Mesh

#### Install Linkerd

In the Tilt UI there is a 'node' icon with the text "Install Linkerd": pressing
this button will install the Linkerd service mesh in your local cluster. Once
installed, Linkerd will encrypt all traffic between pods with TLS.

While the service mesh is important to secure production installs, it is not
normally necessary when running the dev cluster locally. This functionality
exists in the development workflow so that changes that might affect
communication between pods can be tested locally with the service mesh in
place.

Two new namespaces will be created (linkerd and linkerd-viz) and the linkerd
containers and the associated visualization components (Prometheus and Grafana)
will be installed in your dev cluster.

**Prerequisites:**

1. The cluster must be created, and Enduro must be up and running.
   - see [Set Up](#set-up) instructions above
2. Linkerd CLI must be installed - there are a few ways to accomplish this. See
   the [Linkerd CLI install page]

**Install Linkerd in your local cluster:**

1. Press the 'Install Linkerd' button. This will start the process: first
   Linkerd will be installed, then the visualization components, then the Enduro
   containers will have the Linkerd service mesh injected, and finally the Enduro
   containers will be restarted. This process can take a few mins to complete.

2. View the state of all pods being created using the command:

- `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
- You will see the linkerd and linkerd-viz pods start to appear in this list.

3. Once the 'linkerd-viz' pods become visible, you can attempt to launch the
   linkerd Dashboard:

- `linkerd viz dashboard`
- It may take a few mins for the pods to stabilize and the dahboard to appear.
- Look in the 'default' namespace - you should hopefully see all Enduro
  containers meshed: 10/10

4. Check the state of the service mesh:

- `linkerd check`

#### Delete Linkerd pods and un-mesh your local cluster

There is a second icon in the Tilt UI (trashcan) which will completely remove
Linkerd and it's associated Dashboard and then restart all pods in the cluster.
Use this when Linkerd is no longer required for testing.

**Note**: There is a timing issue where some of the pods may be in the process of
shutting down which will prevent Linkerd pods from being uninstalled. The
button may be required to be pressed a second time.

**Remove Linkerd:**

1. Press the 'Remove Linkerd' button.
2. Test if removal has completed:

- `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
  - if the 'linkerd' and 'linkerd-viz' namespace pods do not disappear after a
    few mins, press the trashcan button a second time.
  - the specific error will look like:
  ```
  Please uninject the following pods before uninstalling the control-plane:
  * redis-578d59c764-rwbr2
  * mysql-6f8cc976cb-bzm62
  * enduro-dashboard-9656656b-vgs7g
  ```
  - pressing the trashcan button a second time will clear up this error.

### Known issues

#### Minio uploads don't trigger workflows

The setup of the Minio buckets and the communication between Minio and Redis
is sometimes not setup properly. To solve it, from the Tilt UI, restart the
`minio` resource and then trigger the `minio-setup-buckets` resource.
