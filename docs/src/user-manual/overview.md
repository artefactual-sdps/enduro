# Overview and getting started with Enduro

[Enduro][Enduro] is a new application under development by [Artefactual
Systems]. Designed following digital preservation standards and best practices,
our goal with Enduro is to ensure records of the past can be cared for in the
present and trusted in the future.

The application borrows terminology from the digital preservation domain - a
full **glossary of terms** and how we define them in the Enduro project can be
found at:

* [Glossary](glossary.md)

Originally created as a more stable replacement for Archivematicaâ€™s
[automation-tools][automation-tools] library of scripts, Enduro has since
evolved into a flexible tool to be paired with preservation applications to
provide initial ingest activities such as content and structure validation,
packaging, and more. To learn more about the components that make up Enduro,
see:

* [Components](components.md)

Below you'll find basic instructions on how to login to the application and an
overview of some of the first pages you will encounter. While the Enduro user
interface provides a single seamless experience for operators, behind the scenes
the code is organized into functional modules based on different stages of the
digital preservation lifecycle. Currently these include:

* [Ingest](ingest/index.md)
* Storage

## Logging in

Depending on the [installation process][iac], the application can be
configured to require no authentication. However, Enduro optionally supports
external OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible providers for authentication and
access control. Users can authenticate against the external provider from the
dashboard - if authentication has been enabled, then when first arriving, users
will see a sign-in button:

![The sign-in button when first navigating to Enduro](screenshots/sign-in-button.png)

When clicked, users will be redirected to the provider's authentication page.
After successfully submitting valid credentials, users will then be redirected
back to Enduro's landing page.

Welcome to Enduro!

### User filters and authentication configuration

There are several places in Enduro where, if user information is available,
Enduro will display it in the user interface as an "Uploaded by" element.
Examples include:

* The results column on the
  [SIP browse page](ingest/search-browse.md#browsing-results)
* The [user filter](ingest/search-browse.md#filter-by-uploader) on the SIP
  browse page
* The user metadata element on the
  [SIP details page](ingest/managing-ingest-workflows.md#sip-details)

However, _what_ and _how_ information is displayed in these elements depends on
whether or not authentication is enabled and if so, what user details are
available from the authentication provider.

If [authentication is enabled][iac], then Enduro will first try to show the user
name. If a name is not available from the provider, an email address will be
used instead, and if neither are provided then Enduro will use a locally
generated UUID to uniquely identify the uploader.

If authentication is **not** enabled and/or the identity of the uploader cannot
be known (for example, ingest is started via a
[watched location upload][watched-location]), Enduro will simply show "Unknown"
in the  Uploaded by field.

## Landing page and About widget

The **landing page** is the first thing that operators will encounter after
logging in. It contains a brief introduction to the application, including a
link to the Enduro documentation.

Clicking the **info icon** in the top right corner of the Enduro header bar will
open an About widget with further information and links, including the
application version, the configured preservation engine, the name of the
workflows in use, and more.

## Navigation

The **Navbar** on the left side of the application is the primary method of
navigation in Enduro. This navbar is available on all pages, and users can
return to the landing page at any time, either by clicking "Home" in the navbar
menu, or by clicking the Enduro logo above the navbar.

As users navigate to different pages using the navbar, the header will show a
**breadcrumb trail** to orient the user. The breadcrumb trail can also be used
for navigation - clickable pages (such as the "SIPs" link in the image below)
are shown in purple, while informational separators that cannot be navigated to
(such as the "Ingest" part of the breadcrumb trail in the image below) are shown
in grey.

The navbar can also be expanded or collapsed to increase screen space. To do so,
click the three lines in the header bar next to the Enduro logo:

## Logging out

To logout of Enduro, click the username shown at the bottom of the navbar. This
widget will expand to show a Sign out button - click this to exit the
application:
