# Enduro SDPS

[Enduro](https://github.com/artefactual-sdps/enduro) is a tool that was
developed to automate the processing of transfers in multiple Archivematica
pipelines.

This version of Enduro uses [a3m](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/a3m)
instead of Archivematica to preserve digital objects, alongside
[MinIO](https://min.io/) for object storage and [Temporal](https://temporal.io/)
to manage the workflow. This combination of tools is intended to be lightweight,
scalable, and easy to install.
