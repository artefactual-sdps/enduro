# User manual

This is a user manual for SDPS Enduro, a version of the Enduro project that
uses a3m to preserve digital objects.

## What is SDPS Enduro?

Enduro is a tool that was developed to automate the processing of transfers in 
multiple Archivematica pipelines. In this project, Archivematica has been
swapped out for a3m.

The a3m project is a streamlined, lightweight version of Archivematica that is
wholly focused on AIP creation. It does not have external dependencies,
integration with access sytems, search capabilities, or a graphical interface.
It was designed to reduce the bulk of Archivematica's extraneous functions for
users operating at a large scale and who are more focused on throughput of
digital objects for preservation.

SDPS Enduro uses Minio for object storage and Temporal to manage the workflow.
